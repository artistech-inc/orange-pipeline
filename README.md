## Downloading

`git clone https://github.com/artistech-inc/green-pipeline-web.git`

## Configuration

Update the [WEB-INF/web.xml](https://github.com/artistech-inc/green-pipeline-web/blob/master/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml) file. Each Servlet that utilizes an external application/script/process must have the path to the application set. For now, this includes:

- joint_ere
- ENIE
- Merge Tool
- Visualization Generation

Along with the web.xml file, the [META-INF/context.xml](https://github.com/artistech-inc/green-pipeline-web/blob/master/src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml) must be configured. The `data_path` value must be somewhere that Tomcat can write to.

## Compilation

This project should be able opened using Netbeans as a Maven Web-App. It will automatically detect the type of project.

The project can also be compiled on the command line directly using maven.

```sh
cd green-pipeline-web
mvn clean package
```

## Deployment

The output from compilation is in the `target/` directory as `green-pipeline-web-1.2.war`. This war can be deployed to Tomcat's `webapps` directory. Once deployed, it can be accessed via `http://<ip_address:port>/green-pipeline-web-1.2/`.
